# Frontend Assessment "number8" Documentation

## Introduction

Welcome to the documentation for the Frontend Assessment "number8", a state-of-the-art platform designed to streamline the property search and listing process. This document serves as a comprehensive guide to the application's architecture, technologies, and organizational structure.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.


## High-Level Architecture

The application leverages a modular, feature-based architecture, ensuring that each feature is encapsulated with all necessary components such as types, state management, views, and more. We prioritize scalability and maintainability, enabling the application to grow and adapt over time.

### Performance

Utilizing the latest features of Next.js, we employ Server-Side Rendering (SSR) primarily in the List of Properties component. This reduces client-side JavaScript requirements and takes advantage of server caching, enhancing performance and user experience.

### Scalability

Our architecture supports scalable development by organizing features into self-contained modules. The application uses TypeScript to ensure that data structures are clearly defined and understood, preventing runtime errors and facilitating easier team collaboration.

With scalability in mind, the project is structured to accommodate incremental development and integration:

- **Modular Architecture:** Features are self-contained within their respective modules.

- **State Management:** Utilizing Redux Toolkit, we adhere to the Flux architecture for predictable state management, which is crucial for large-scale applications.
- 
- **TypeScript:** The use of TypeScript provides strong typing, facilitating clearer data flow and reducing runtime errors.
- 
### Reusability

Our codebase follows a clean code approach, ensuring that variable names are intuitive and self-documenting. We've established a components directory dedicated to UI elements, which can be reused across the application. This directory is poised for expansion to include a wider range of UI `components`, and it aligns with any forthcoming design system updates.
### Design Patterns

The app's design follows a combination of Domain-Driven Design (DDD), Modular, State Management, and Component Architecture patterns. These patterns form the foundation of our application's structure, enabling organized and scalable development.

### State Management

Redux Toolkit is utilized for state management following the Flux architecture. It manages the property state, allowing users to save properties and view details seamlessly across different pages.

## Technologies Used

The app is crafted with the following key technologies:

- **Next.js**: The core framework providing server-side rendering and static site generation.
- **React**: Powers the UI with a component-based architecture.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework used for styling.
- **Redux Toolkit**: Simplifies state management with best practices out of the box.
- **TypeScript**: Adds static typing to enhance code reliability and developer experience, ensures that data structures and API contracts are strictly typed, enhancing developer experience and code stability. It helps to catch errors early in the development process and provides an auto-completed and self-documented codebase.
  
This tech stack was chosen for its performance, developer ergonomics, and community support, ensuring that the application is built on a solid and future-proof foundation.

## Folder Organization


- **`/src`**: The main source directory containing the application logic and components.
    - **`/app`**: Core pages and global styles.
    - **`/components`**: Reusable UI components.
    - **`/features`**: Independent business feature modules.
    - **`/redux`**: Configuration and setup for Redux Toolkit.
    - **`/types`**: TypeScript type definitions.
    - **`/util`**: Utility functions and helpers.
- **`/public`**: Static assets such as images and icons.
- **`/styles`**: Global CSS styles applied across the application.


The application's codebase is meticulously organized as follows:

## Additional Notes

- **State Management:** The Redux toolkit is used for managing the property state, particularly for rendering property details.
- **Server Cache:** Leveraging server cache for optimized data retrieval and reduced latency.

## Conclusion
